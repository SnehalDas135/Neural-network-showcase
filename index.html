                <h3>What Are Neural Networks?</h3>
                <p>Neural networks are computer systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of nodes, or "neurons," that process data and learn patterns. These networks help machines recognize images, understand speech, and make intelligent predictions.</p>

                <h3>How Neural Networks Work</h3>
                <p>Neural networks work by passing data through multiple layers. Each layer transforms the input into a more abstract form, allowing the system to learn complex relationships. The learning process adjusts the strength of connections, called weights, to minimize errors.</p>

                <h3>Types of Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>There are different types of neural networks designed for specific tasks. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) are the simplest form where data moves in one direction. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonly used for image recognition. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are useful for sequential data like text or speech.</p>
